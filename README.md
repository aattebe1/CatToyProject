CatToyProject uses a SiLabs C8051F340 MCU.  It is designed to work in
two different modesâ€”automatic and manual.  In automatic mode, one of
three mice pop out of a box randomly.  In this mode, the speed can be
changed with the keypad.

In manual mode, the mice are controlled manually using the keypad.
Only one mouse is active at a time, so the currently active mouse
retracts when another is selected.

The keypad is used to switch between the two program modes.
